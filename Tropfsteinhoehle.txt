 <sal> I hear drip drops of water into a giant cavern
 <SDH> setting, gameplay, story, characters, ALL THE SAME



Die Tropfsteinhöhle


DESCRIPTION:
There are several stalactites in the cavern, and each builds up water.  On the cavern floor are frogs, and you must keep them moist in order for them to survive.

Window size: ??? x ???
Distance water has to fall: ?

|_________________________________|


Each stalactite, V,  is given a letter and a semi-transparent bar that indicated how much water is built up on the tip.

On the ground are a number of frogs moving randomly of three different colors: bright green, pale green, and brown
The color is indicative of how moist the frog's skin is.  If it goes beyond brown, the frog dies leaving a dead frog mark spot on the ground.  When the frogs meet each other, one of them will become pregnant and eventually give birth to a sickly looking grey frog that does not require water to live.


OBJECTIVE:
Keep the frogs moist until frogs of the opposite sex have a chance to mate and produce 2 non-water-needing babies. (don't ask me how this works.)



CONDITIONS FOR WIN:
The frogs produce 2 or more non-water-needing babies


CONDITIONS FOR LOSS:
All the frogs of one sex die (maybe for easy mode--make sex of frogs irrelevant)
	-except when two or more pregnant frogs live

Not enough frogs remain to produce desired outcome.
	-lone non-pregnant frog
	-lone pregnant frog but no babies in the field	



FROG ASPECTS:
Frogs move in any of the 8 directions 1 square at a time and have a 3/4 chance of moving the direction previously moved.

Bright green: 67-100 - frog's water level cannot go past 100
Pale green: 34-66
Brown: 1-33
Dead: 0 - not affected by water
Light grey: special - not affected by water


STALACTITE ASPECTS:
Pressing the letter drops the water to the ground.  

If the stalactite becomes over-laden with water, it will fall. The bar will blink 3 times before the water drops on its own.

The water can not be released until it is 3/4 laden.

Splash effects to water when fully laden?  Perhaps neighboring squares receive 1/? the value of the water, and the landing zone receives less (due to splash effect)
